//I want to add some words from my part. From the part of the human language lol. So first of all It's my first minecraft plugin and i do not absolutely know how to do most of the scripts. I tried to fix some bugs but i do have them in my code.
//Thank you all who had downloaded this plugin, thanks and good bye!
//Maybe i will do the updates if you will find the plugin funny :)
